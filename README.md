# Baby Names in France - Visualization Project

## Overview
In this mini-project, we explore a dataset of baby names registered in France from 1900 through 2020. The dataset includes two subsets:
1. Aggregated data at the national level.
2. Data segmented by department.

The project aims to create three distinct visualizations, each addressing different questions about the data.

## Objectives

### Visualization 1: Evolution of Baby Names Over Time
- **Questions to Answer**:
  - How do baby names evolve over time?
  - Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular?
  - Are there names that were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular?
  - Are there observable trends over time?

### Visualization 2: Regional Effects in Baby Names
- **Questions to Answer**:
  - Is there a regional effect in the data?
  - Are some names more popular in specific regions?
  - Are popular names generally popular across the whole country?

### Visualization 3: Gender Effects in Baby Names
- **Questions to Answer**:
  - Are there gender effects in the data?
  - Does the popularity of names given to both sexes evolve consistently?
  - Note: The dataset treats sex as binary, which is a simplification carried into this assignment.

## Project Parts

### Part 1: Sketch Design Alternatives
- **Task**: Sketch different design alternatives for each visualization to address the respective questions.
- **Goal**: Explore various ways to represent the data visually, considering clarity, effectiveness, and aesthetics.

### Part 2: Implement Visualizations
- **Task**: Implement the chosen design for each visualization using one of the tools from the class lab assignments (e.g., D3.js, Matplotlib, Tableau).
- **Goal**: Develop functional visualizations that effectively answer the set questions.

### Part 3: Refine Visualizations
- **Task**: Refine the initial implementations based on feedback and further iteration.
- **Goal**: Enhance the visualizations for better accuracy, readability, and visual appeal.

## Data Description

### National Level Data
- Contains the list of all baby names registered in France from 1900 through 2020, aggregated at the national level.

### Department Level Data
- Contains the list of all baby names registered in France from 1900 through 2020, segmented by department.

## Getting Started

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load the dataset and familiarize yourself with its structure and content.
   - Clean the data if necessary (handle missing values, correct inconsistencies).

2. **Design Phase**:
   - Sketch multiple designs for each visualization.
   - Consider the best way to present the data to answer the specific questions.
   - Select the most effective and feasible design for implementation.

3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Choose the appropriate tool for your visualizations.
   - Implement the selected designs, ensuring they accurately represent the data and answer the questions.

4. **Refinement Phase**:
   - Gather feedback on the initial visualizations.
   - Make improvements to enhance clarity, accuracy, and visual appeal.

## Conclusion
This project will provide insights into how baby names in France have evolved over time, the impact of regional differences, and gender-related trends in naming. By creating and refining these visualizations, you'll gain hands-on experience in data visualization and the ability to effectively communicate complex data through visual means.
